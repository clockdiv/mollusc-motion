  <p>
    <b>mollusc motion</b> is a toolkit that allows users to record and edit
    sensor data (e.g. from body movement) in Blender and either animate
    <i>digital</i> objects and characters or <i>physical</i> objects with
    stepper- and servo-motors.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's intend is to <b>animate non-human characters</b>, digital and physical
    objects and puppets or animatronics of all kind.
  </p>
  <p>
    What is it <b>not</b>? mollusc motion is not a full body motion tracking
    system like the Rokoko Smartsuit or other motion tracking systems.
